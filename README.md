# SOC Lab with Real-Time Threat Monitoring

![Title image](./images/title-image.png)


This repo is the **full deep dive** into my SOC Homelab project where I built a **mini Security Operations Center** using open-source tools like Wazuh, Suricata, pfSense, and more... all from scratch.  
Oh, and yes ‚Äî **custom rules, Sysmon logs, MITRE ATT&CK mappings, and Atomic Red Team tests** are all here! üí£üíª

## Abstract

This project presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a SOC homelab capable of real-time cyber threat detection and incident response. The lab utilizes open-source tools including:

- Wazuh for SIEM
- Suricata for network intrusion detection
- pfSense for firewall management
- Atomic Red Team tests 
- Integration of VirusTotal and Abuse IP DB
- Slack configuration in wazuh for notification of alerts

Key features:
- Simulates attack scenarios (brute-force attacks, malware infections, file integrity violations)
- Implements MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Integrates real-time Slack alerting
- Managed using Jira for project tracking

## Hardware Requirements

| Component           | Memory (RAM) | Storage |
|---------------------|--------------|---------|
| Wazuh SIEM VM       | 12 GB        | 50+ GB  |
| PfSense Firewall VM | 4 GB         | 20 GB   |
| Windows Server VM   | 8 GB         | 10 GB   |
| Windows Client VM   | 4 GB         | 10 GB   |
| Kali Linux VM       | 4 GB         | 10 GB   |


## SOC Homelab Architecture

### Core Components
- **Host System**: Windows machine running VMware Workstation Pro 17 (Free License)
- **pfSense Firewall**: Central gateway for all network traffic
- **Segmented Networks**:
  - `VMnet2`: Kali Linux attack machine (192.168.1.2)
  - `VMnet3`: Domain Controller + Victim machines
  - `VMnet4`: Wazuh SIEM server (192.168.4.1)


### Core Components

#### SIEM (Wazuh)

#### Firewall (pfSense)

#### Network Architecture

### Configuration Steps

1. **pfSense Setup**:
   - Interface configuration
   - NAT and IP forwarding
   - Syslog integration with Wazuh

2. **Wazuh Installation**:
   - Server setup
   - Agent deployment

## Simulated Attack Scenarios

- **Firewall Access Blocking:** Created detection rules to block attacker access via firewall.

- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**: Implemented FIM to detect unauthorized changes in critical files.

- **RDP Brute-force and SQL Injection Protection:** Developed detection mechanisms for SSH/RDP brute-force attacks and SQL Injection attacks.

- **MITRE ATT&CK Tactics:** Executed Atomic Red Team tests on Windows endpoints, extracted relevant logs using Sysmon, forwarded them to Wazuh, and developed detection rules mapped to specific ATT&CK technique IDs for accurate threat identification.

- **Malicious Commands:** Detection rules for Linux endpoints. 

- **Alerting & Notifications:** Set up alerting system with notifications directly to Slack for real-time threat updates.

## Configured Attack Emulations Using MITRE ATT&CK Framework and Atomic Red Team Tests

| Technique | Description 
|-----------|-------------
| T1053 | Scheduled Task/Job 
| T1218.010 | Regsvr32 Execution 
| T1518.001 | Security Software Discovery 
| T1548.003 | Windows Service Modification
| T1123 | Audio Capture
